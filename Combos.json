You will need to contact the Registrars/Part Time office to resolve this and they will then be in a position to remove the hold. Your login credentials will then become active again automatically. \n\nPart time students should contact the Part Time Office:\n\nhttp://www.it-tallaght.ie/part-time-services\n\n\n\nFulltime students should contact the Finance Department:\n\n+353 1 4042061 or fulltimefees@it-tallaght.ie\n\n\nIf you still have difficulty following that, please contact us again if you require a password reset etc.\n\nKind regards,\n\nGraham Smith\n\n",
